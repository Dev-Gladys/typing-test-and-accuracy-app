texts=["Albert Einstein: was a German-born theoretical physicist,[7] widely acknowledged to be one of the "
       "greatest and most influential physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory"
       " of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics."
       " Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics.[3][8] His mass–energy equivalence"
       " formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed the world's most famous equation." ,

       "Albert Einstein work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.[10][11] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics " \
       "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect"
       "a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "
       "Einstein becoming synonymous with genius In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'). ",

       "Thomas Einstein published four groundbreaking papers.[14] These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained "
       "Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and demonstrated mass-energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the"
       " laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to"
       " develop his special theory of relativity.",

       " Albert Einstein then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published a paper on"
       " general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity "
       "to model the structure of the universe.[15][16] He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum "
       "theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. ",

       " Albert Einstein enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal polytechnic"
       " school in Zürich, graduating in 1900. In 1901, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life,"
       " and in 1903 he secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he was awarded a PhD by the "
       "University of Zurich. In 1914, Einstein moved to Berlin in order to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt"
       " University of Berlin. In 1917, Einstein became director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics; he also became a "
       "German citizen again, this time Prussian.",

       "Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 – October 18, 1931) was an American inventor and businessman."
       " He developed many devices in fields such as electric power generation, mass communication, sound recording, "
       "and motion pictures. These inventions, which include the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and early versions "
       "of the electric light bulb, have had a widespread impact on the modern industrialized world. He was one of the first"
       " inventors to apply the principles of organized science and teamwork to the process of invention, working with many"
       " researchers and employees.",

       " Thomas Alva Edison established the first industrial research laboratory.Edison was raised in the American"
       " Midwest; early in his career, he worked as a telegraph operator, which inspired some of his earliest inventions."
       " In 1876, he established his first laboratory facility in Menlo Park, New Jersey, where many of his early inventions"
       " were developed. He later established a botanical laboratory in Fort Myers, Florida, in collaboration with businessmen"
       " Henry Ford and Harvey S. Firestone, and a laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey, that featured the world's first film "
